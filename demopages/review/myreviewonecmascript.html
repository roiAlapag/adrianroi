                <p>In this video, I learn about the history of JavaScript. JavaScript's history has been a rollercoaster ride with many ups and downs. Creating  a programming language where developers can easily read and understand was merely impossible not until Brendan Eich invented it in just 10 days and named it as Mocha which is renamed to LiveScript then JavaScript.  JavaScript refused to be added to the Microsoft web browser which is the Internet Explorer, as both company has their own web browser and programming language.  In this case, most of the developers are
                     having a hard time in supporting both web browsers. To put a stop to the confusion, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for a standard specification. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published ECMAScript, which became the standard specification. Up to 2017, new versions were released. JavaScript had become the language of the web by the time ECMAScript was released, and it was the most important language to learn because it could be used in both the front-end and the back-end.</p>

                <p>In this video, I discover why it's called Vanilla JavaScript in the first place. My conclusion before was that it was named vanilla since the person who invented it enjoys vanilla, but I was completely incorrect.
                    It was named Vanilla JavaScript because it was a plain JavaScript. They used Vanilla because it is plain same as the program which does not have additional frameworks or libraries in it.  Learning this helps me to understand and gain knowledge about this course.</p>

                <p>In this video, I will discuss how crucial it was for me to learn JavaScript as a developer. The man in the video checked the popularity of JavaScript throughout the decade in the first minute of the video. Seeing the results made me realize that JavaScript has become less popular, possibly due
                     to the fact that it is an old programming language that few developers are familiar with. As more developers become interested in learning new programming languages, the majority of developers recognize the true value of JavaScript. That the foundation of JavaScript will remains important in web development.</p>
