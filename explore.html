                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Adrian Roi G. Alapag and I am 21 years old. I am now pursuing an Information Technology degree at the University of the Immaculate Conception. Eating, doing art, and watching anime are some of my favorite pastimes.
                     When it comes to eating, I am not picky. I accept all of the food that is offered to me. But when it comes to my favorite cuisines, Adobo, Sinigang, Chicken Curry, and Ramen are among them. When it comes to art, I use it to bring calm and happiness into my life. 
                     Although most of my designs are cartoons, I am attempting to learn various art styles in order to enhance my artistic knowledge. Crimson is my favorite color, and orange is my least favorite among all the available color. Hello and thank you for visiting my website.</p>

                <h2>Journey</h2>
                <p>In the field of web developement, I can be described as a beginner, newbie, rookie, freshman, and so on.  My journey to this profession is only starting, and it is full of ups and downs. 
                    My journey may not be as beautiful as others', but it is unique in that it helps me to grow as a person and a developer. My proudest achievement is that I completed my freshman year.
                     I hope that my experiences will encourage me in becoming a successful developer in the near future.</p>
